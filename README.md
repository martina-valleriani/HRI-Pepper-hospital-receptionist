# HRI-Pepper-hospital-receptionist

This project is developed by Pietro Nardelli and Martina Valleriani for the course of "Human-Robot Interaction" held by professor Luca Iocchi at La Sapienza, University of Rome, Italy.

The focus is on the interaction between Pepper robot as receptionist and the patients of a hospital. The robot has the goal to receive and welcome patients by handling the appointments and admission services, besides by giving general information. The patients can interact with the robot by means of speech or using the Pepper's built-in tablet and have to show an identification QR code in order to book a medical examination or to be admitted to a visit. Thanks to this code, Pepper can manage and personalise the communication and the interaction with the user.
In order to develop this application, we make use of the NAOqi framework and MODIM software.
